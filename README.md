## About The Game

**CyberDeck Duel** is a final year project that brings cybersecurity education to life through an interactive, turn-based card game. Created in February 2024 and currently ongoing, this native Android application leverages **Java** and **Firebase** (for Authentication and Realtime Database) to deliver a robust Game-Based Learning (GBL) experience.

The game uniquely educates players on **Privilege Escalation techniques and mitigations** using engaging gameplay. It draws inspiration from the **MITRE ATT&CK® Matrix for Enterprise** knowledge base, ensuring the cybersecurity scenarios are relevant and accurate. By blending mechanics from Collectible Card Games (CCG) and Trading Card Games (TCG), CyberDeck Duel simulates real-world cybersecurity challenges in an accessible and fun format. Players can also track their progress through a **progression system** and analyze their strategies with **post-game analysis**.

## How To Play

In CyberDeck Duel, each match is a strategic duel where players aim to achieve the highest total power points.

1.  **Deck & Cards:** Players start with 10 random cards from their deck, each displaying vital details: name, description, type (Attack or Defense), category, and power points.
2.  **Turns & Time Limit:** Players alternate turns, with a 2-minute time limit per turn, ensuring fast-paced gameplay.
3.  **Card Placement:**
    * **Attack Cards:** Place these in the **Attack Row**.
    * **Defense Cards:** Place these in the **Defense Row**.
4.  **Strategic Matching:** Success hinges on matching Defense cards to their corresponding Attack cards at the right time. Improper or early placement of Defense cards will render them ineffective, emphasizing critical thinking and timing.
5.  **Winning Condition:** The game continues until all cards are played. The player with the highest total power points at the end of the match wins!

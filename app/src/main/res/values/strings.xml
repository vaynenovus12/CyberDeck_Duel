    <string name="policy">CyberDeck Duel (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes our data collection, usage, and security practices. We collect personal information (such as name, email, date of birth, and gender) during account creation to manage user accounts and provide gameplay functionality. In-game data, including deck composition, coins, scores, and game statistics, are collected to improve user experience and track progress. Device information, such as model and operating system, may also be collected for debugging and security. We do not sell or rent personal information to third parties. Information may be shared only with trusted service providers (e.g., Firebase) for data management or for legal reasons if required by law. Data security is paramount, and we use Firebase’s security features to protect user data; however, we advise users to keep their credentials private. Users can manage account details by logging in, and may contact us to delete their accounts if desired. CyberDeck Duel is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from them. This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically, and we encourage users to review it regularly. For any questions, please contact us at support@example.com.</string>
